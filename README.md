# emptysizes
Origins mod datapack, primarily for a Minecraft server 

Inspired by [Tinkerer's Statures](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tinkerers-statures)\). Not compatible with it. Provides (mostly small) size options meant to meaningfully impact gameplay

Recommended to use with mods such as [Bits and Chisels](https://modrinth.com/mod/bits-and-chisels) and [Dramatic Doors](https://modrinth.com/mod/dramatic-doors) to more easily make size-appropriate player housing

Fabric only for now, Forge version maybe later
